### **Development Philosophy**
- **One Feature at a Time** - Systematic, tested implementation
- **Quality Gates** - Every feature must pass comprehensive testing
- **Gradual Rollout** - Feature flags for safe user exposure
- **Real-World Validation** - Staging environment testing before production
- **Instant Rollback** - Monitoring with immediate rollback capability

## üìã DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGY
