# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Zenith Fresh is a Next.js 14 SaaS platform with AI-driven optimization features that has persistent Vercel deployment issues. The app includes authentication, dashboard, analytics, and various optimization engines but suffers from environment variable configuration problems and missing production features.

## Critical Commands

### Development
```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server (uses PORT env var, defaults to 3000)
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build

# Start production server
npm start

# Run linting
npm run lint

# Run type checking (if configured)
npm run typecheck || npx tsc --noEmit
```

### Testing
```bash
# No test suite configured yet
# Health check endpoint: GET /api/health
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Deployment
```bash
# Vercel deployment (requires VERCEL_TOKEN)
vercel --prod

# Docker development
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Note: Docker production deployment is broken (missing server.js)
```

## Architecture & Key Issues

### Current State
- **Framework**: Next.js 14.2.30 with App Router
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with Prisma (configured but NOT connected)
- **Auth**: Custom in-memory session management (NOT secure)
- **Deployment**: Vercel (primary) and Docker (broken)

### Critical Production Issues

1. **Lib Module Runtime Failures (CRITICAL)**
   - ALL lib modules will fail due to missing dependencies (`fetch` not imported)
   - Memory leaks in `auto-scaler.js` (unbounded array growth)
   - Security vulnerabilities with exposed hardcoded credentials
   - Missing environment variables will cause AI features to fail silently
   - External API calls to non-existent endpoints will throw ECONNREFUSED

2. **Edge Runtime Incompatibilities (CRITICAL)**
   - API routes use `runtime = 'edge'` but rely on Node.js APIs
   - `process.memoryUsage()` not available in edge runtime (health check will fail)
   - In-memory storage (Maps, arrays) reset on every function invocation
   - Authentication system completely broken - sessions lost between requests
   - Rate limiting ineffective due to stateless execution

3. **Component Hydration Issues (HIGH)**
   - Dashboard pages missing `'use client'` directive will cause hydration errors
   - Admin panel uses `localStorage` without SSR compatibility checks
   - API calls in components lack proper error boundaries

4. **Import Path Failures (CRITICAL)**
   - `/api/users/route.js` imports from incorrect path `../../../../lib/auth-system.js`
   - Module resolution will fail in production edge runtime
   - Missing class imports in lib modules will cause ReferenceError

5. **Environment Variables Not Loading**
   - App expects vars from `.env.local` but Vercel needs them in dashboard
   - Missing validation at startup causes silent failures
   - Key missing vars: `DATABASE_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_URL`, `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`

6. **Database Not Connected**
   - Prisma schema exists but no Prisma Client instantiation
   - All data operations use mock/in-memory storage
   - No connection pooling or error handling

7. **Authentication Security**
   - Hardcoded credentials in `lib/auth-system.js`
   - Session storage is in-memory (lost on restart)
   - No middleware-level route protection

8. **Missing Error Handling**
   - No error.tsx or not-found.tsx pages
   - No error boundaries for runtime errors
   - API errors return generic 500s

9. **Deployment Conflicts**
   - `next.config.js` has `output: 'standalone'` for Docker
   - Dockerfile references non-existent `server.js`
   - Vercel deployment had "phantom component" issues

## Environment Variable Requirements

### Required in Production
```env
# Database (currently not used but required by Prisma)
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@host:5432/db

# Authentication (checked by health endpoint)
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://your-domain.vercel.app
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=generate-with-openssl-rand-base64-32

# Master Admin
MASTER_USERNAME=zenith_master
MASTER_PASSWORD=strong-password-here

# AI Services (used by optimization engines)
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-...
```

### Vercel-Specific Setup
1. Add all env vars in Vercel dashboard under Settings > Environment Variables
2. Ensure vars are available for Production, Preview, and Development
3. Redeploy after adding variables

## Common Fix Procedures

### Fix "Environment variables not found"
1. Check Vercel dashboard for missing vars
2. Add validation to `src/app/api/health/route.js`
3. Create env validation script

### Fix "Database connection failed"
1. Instantiate Prisma Client in `lib/db.js`
2. Add connection pooling
3. Implement retry logic
4. Add fallback for local development

### Fix "404 on protected routes"
1. Add auth check to middleware.js
2. Create proper error boundaries
3. Implement loading states

### Fix "API routes failing"
1. Check edge runtime compatibility
2. Add proper error handling
3. Validate request bodies
4. Add CORS headers if needed

## Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to Vercel:
1. âœ“ All environment variables set in Vercel dashboard
2. âœ“ Remove or fix Docker-specific configurations
3. âœ“ Ensure no hardcoded credentials
4. âœ“ Test health endpoint locally
5. âœ“ Clear Vercel cache if deployment fails
6. âœ“ Check for .gitmodules file (even if empty)

## Known Issues & Workarounds

1. **"Phantom component" errors**: DEPLOYMENT_STATUS.md indicates previous issues with non-existent components being cached by Vercel. Solution was to strip down to minimal components.

2. **Edge runtime limitations**: Memory usage functions in health check may not work in edge runtime.

3. **Docker deployment broken**: Dockerfile expects server.js which doesn't exist. Either create it or update Dockerfile to use Next.js standalone output.

4. **No real data persistence**: Everything uses in-memory storage. Must implement Prisma Client and database connections for production.

## Testing Production Readiness

```bash
# 1. Check all routes return 200
curl -I https://your-app.vercel.app/
curl -I https://your-app.vercel.app/api/health

# 2. Verify auth flow
# Should redirect to /auth/signin
curl -I https://your-app.vercel.app/dashboard

# 3. Check API authentication
curl -X POST https://your-app.vercel.app/api/auth \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username":"zenith_master","password":"your-password"}'

# 4. Monitor logs in Vercel dashboard for errors
```
