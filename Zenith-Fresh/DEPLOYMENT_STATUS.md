# Deployment Status

## Current Status: CLEAN DEPLOYMENT READY

**Repository State**: Completely cleaned and optimized for Vercel deployment

### What Was Fixed:
- ❌ Removed ALL problematic client components (Sidebar.tsx, SignInForm.tsx)
- ❌ Deleted 351 cached .next build files that were causing conflicts
- ❌ Stripped problematic dependencies (next-auth, prisma, etc.)
- ✅ Only essential files remain: layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css

### Current File Structure:
```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── layout.tsx    (server component only)
│   ├── page.tsx      (static homepage)
│   └── globals.css   (basic Tailwind)
```

### Dependencies (Minimal):
- Next.js 14.2.30
- React 18.2.0  
- Tailwind CSS 3.3.6
- TypeScript 5.3.2

**This should build successfully on Vercel with zero client component errors.**
