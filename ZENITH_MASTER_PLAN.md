## Section A: First Mission - Agentic Self-Healing

### The Ultimate Test: Agents Fix Their Own Platform

**Mission**: "Diagnose Production Anomaly"  
**Goal**: Demonstrate true autonomy by having agents identify, diagnose, and fix the 500 error on the live platform

### Execution Flow

graph TD
    A[Internal Dashboard: "Diagnose Production Anomaly"] --> B[PerformanceAgent: Scan Production Logs]
    B --> C[Identifies: /api/analysis/website/scan failing]
    C --> D[DeveloperAgent: Analyze Failing Route]
    D --> E[Diagnosis: Dead endpoint + incorrect button href]
    E --> F[DeveloperAgent: Generate Fix]
    F --> G[Create branch: fix/500-error-landing-page]
    G --> H[Commit corrected code]
    H --> I[Submit Pull Request with description]
    I --> J[Human Reviews & Merges]
    J --> K[VICTORY: Agents fixed production bug autonomously]
```

### Agent Coordination

**PerformanceAgent Tasks**:
- Connect to Vercel production logs
- Scan for 500 errors in last 24 hours
- Identify failing endpoint: `/api/analysis/website/scan`
- Report findings to DeveloperAgent

**DeveloperAgent Tasks**:
- Analyze the failing route code
- Identify root cause: Misconfigured endpoint + incorrect button href
- Generate corrected code changing button href to `/dashboard/sandbox`
- Create Git branch `fix/500-error-landing-page`
- Commit fix with proper description
- Submit PR: "Fix: Corrected failing API route on landing page CTA and redirected to appropriate user journey"

**The Win**: Human developer simply reviews and merges. **Agents have successfully diagnosed and fixed a production bug autonomously.**
