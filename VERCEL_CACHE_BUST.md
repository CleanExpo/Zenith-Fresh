# Vercel Cache Bust - Build Fix

This file is created to trigger a fresh Vercel deployment and clear any cached build artifacts that might be causing the phantom `pages/api/health/redis.ts` error.

## Build Issue Analysis
- Error: `./pages/api/health/redis.ts` not found
- Reality: File is correctly located at `src/app/api/health/redis/route.ts`
- Cause: Likely Vercel build cache referencing old file structure

## Solution
1. Add this cache-busting file
2. Commit and push to trigger fresh deployment
3. Vercel will rebuild from scratch without cached references
