# DEPLOYMENT STATUS REPORT

## Issue Identified: Vercel Domain Configuration

The deployment issue has been identified:

### Problem:
- GitHub commits are pushing successfully ✅
- Local build works perfectly ✅  
- Vercel deployment not found (domain `zenith.engineer` not connected properly) ❌

### Solution Required:
The user needs to **manually connect the domain in Vercel Dashboard**:

1. **Go to Vercel Dashboard** → Project Settings
2. **Add Domain**: `zenith.engineer` 
3. **Update DNS**: Point domain to Vercel nameservers
4. **Trigger Redeploy**: Manual trigger from Vercel dashboard

### Alternative Check:
- Check if the project is deployed at the auto-generated Vercel URL
- Example: `https://zenith-fresh-xxx.vercel.app`

### Current Status:
- ✅ Code: All changes committed and pushed to GitHub
- ✅ Build: Local build successful with all features
- ✅ API: Google PageSpeed API key configured  
- ❌ Domain: Custom domain not properly connected

### Next Steps:
1. User should check Vercel dashboard for the auto-generated URL
2. Connect custom domain `zenith.engineer` in Vercel settings
3. Or provide the working Vercel URL for testing

All code changes are ready - this is purely a domain/deployment configuration issue.
