## 🔧 IMMEDIATE DEPLOYMENT STEPS

### **1. Vercel Environment Variables Setup**
Navigate to Vercel Dashboard → Project → Settings → Environment Variables

**Required Core Variables:**
```bash
NEXTAUTH_URL=https://zenith.engineer
NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your-secure-nextauth-secret-here
DATABASE_URL=your-postgresql-connection-string
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret
```

**Required MongoDB Intelligence Variables:**
```bash
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://username:password@cluster.mongodb.net/zenith_production
MONGODB_DB_NAME=zenith_production
```

**Required AI Service Variables:**
```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-proj-your-openai-api-key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-api03-your-anthropic-api-key
GOOGLE_AI_API_KEY=AIza-your-google-ai-api-key
```

**Additional Production Variables:**
```bash
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_live_your-stripe-secret-key
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=pk_live_your-stripe-publishable-key
RESEND_API_KEY=re_your-resend-api-key
NODE_ENV=production
```

### **2. MongoDB Atlas Setup**
- [x] MongoDB Atlas cluster created and accessible
- [x] Database user with read/write permissions configured
- [x] Network access configured for Vercel IP ranges
- [x] Connection string tested and verified

### **3. Deployment Trigger**
```bash
git push origin main
```
This will automatically trigger Vercel deployment.

### **4. Post-Deployment Initialization**
Once deployment is live, run these commands:

```bash
# Initialize MongoDB deployment intelligence system
curl -X POST "https://zenith.engineer/api/deployment/intelligence" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "action": "log-deployment",
    "status": "success",
    "environment": "production",
    "triggeredBy": "production-deployment",
    "buildConfig": {
      "nodeVersion": "18.x",
      "nextjsVersion": "14.2.30",
      "platform": "vercel"
    }
  }'

# Verify system operational
curl "https://zenith.engineer/api/deployment/intelligence?action=insights"

# Check MongoDB health
curl "https://zenith.engineer/api/health/mongodb"
```

### **5. Verification Script**
Run the automated verification:
```bash
node scripts/verify-production-deployment.js
```

### **Monitoring During Rollout:**
- Watch Vercel deployment logs in real-time
- Monitor error rates in Sentry (if configured)
- Check MongoDB Atlas metrics for connection issues
- Verify API endpoint response times
- Test critical user flows immediately after deployment
